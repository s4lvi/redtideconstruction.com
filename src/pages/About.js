              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Red Tide Construction Co. was born from a deep love for Detroit and a commitment to being
                part of its renaissance. Founded in 2008, we started as a small team of local contractors
                who believed that quality construction could help transform communities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, we've grown into one of Michigan's most trusted construction companies,
                but our mission remains the same: to build spaces that strengthen communities and
                honor Detroit's rich architectural heritage.
              </p>
              <p>
                We specialize in projects that matter‚Äîfrom restoring historic homes in Corktown to
                creating new community spaces in Eastern Market, from sustainable landscaping projects
                that beautify neighborhoods to complete residential construction that brings families home.
